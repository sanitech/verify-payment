# 📄 Payment Verification API

This API provides verification services for payment transactions made through **Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)**, **Telebirr**, **Dashen Bank**, **Bank of Abyssinia**, and **CBE Birr** mobile payment platforms in Ethiopia.  
It allows applications to verify the authenticity and details of payment receipts by reference numbers or uploaded images.

## 🌐 Hosting Limitations for `verify-telebirr`

Due to **regional restrictions** by the Telebirr system, hosting the `verify-telebirr` endpoint outside of Ethiopia (e.g., on a VPS like Hetzner or AWS) may result in failed receipt verification. Specifically:

- Telebirr’s receipt pages (`https://transactioninfo.ethiotelecom.et/receipt/[REFERENCE]`) often **block or timeout** requests made from foreign IP addresses.
- This results in errors such as `ERR_FAILED`, `403`, or DNS resolution failures.

### ❌ Affected:

- VPS or cloud servers located outside Ethiopia

### ✅ Works Best On:

- Ethiopian-hosted servers (e.g., Ethio Telecom web hosting, TeleCloud VPS)
- Developers self-hosting the code on infrastructure based in Ethiopia

#### 🛠 Proxy Support:

This project includes a secondary Telebirr verification relay hosted inside Ethiopia. When the primary `verify-telebirr` fetch fails on your foreign VPS, the server can **fallback to our proxy** to complete the verification.

For best results and full control, clone the repository and **self-host from inside Ethiopia**.

---

### 🔁 Skip Primary Verifier (For VPS Users)

If you know your environment cannot access the primary endpoint, set the following in your `.env`:

```env
SKIP_PRIMARY_VERIFICATION=true
```

This will skip the primary Telebirr receipt fetch entirely and go straight to the fallback proxy — only for your local use case. Other users can still benefit from both layers.

## 📝 Logging

- Uses [`winston`](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for structured logging.
- Log files are stored under the `logs/` directory:
  - `logs/error.log` – error-level logs
  - `logs/combined.log` – all logs including debug/info
- `debug` logs are **only visible in development** mode (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`).

To override log level manually:

```env
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```
